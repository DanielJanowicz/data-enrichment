MERGE ERRORS:

Ran into issue with merging the two csv files

After two different merge paths, the first files were shown correctly while the second csv file showed NaN, even after swapping the two around.  

Not sure if it has something to do with the special characters or limited columns picked out.

CLEANING ERROR:

Ran into an issue with cleaning the combined csv file

When I ran the code on lines 46-50, all data was removed.  Skipped over cleaning and instead saved the csv merge to the data folder
